Like all Accelerators they require a Coolant vent in input and output modes and an Energy Port. There must be a continuous ring of Accelerator Beams down the centre, as shown below. Any Beam Port must be placed on the same level as the beam ring and there must be a beam block connecting it to the beam ring."

See Linear Accelerator for more detail."
